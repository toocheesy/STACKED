STACKED! The Card Game 🎴
A fast-paced, strategic card game where pairing and arithmetic collide. Capture cards, stack your combos, and race to victory in this modern take on a classic family favorite.
🧠 What Is STACKED!?
STACKED! is a card game for 2–4 players (currently single-player with AI bots) using a standard 52-card deck. Capture cards from a shared board by matching pairs or adding sums, aiming to score the most points. It blends classic matching with tactical math-based strategy.
🎯 Objective
Score the most points by capturing cards using:

Pairs: Match a card from your hand to a board card.
Sums: Add your hand card with board cards to match another board card.

First to reach 500 (short), 1000 (medium), or 1500 (long) points wins!
🃏 Setup

Use a standard 52-card deck (no Jokers).
The dealer shuffles and deals:
4 cards to each player.
4 face-up cards to the center board.


Play begins with the player (you) against AI bots.

🔁 Gameplay
On your turn:

Capture Cards:
Use one hand card and at least one board card to:
Pair: Match a board card’s value (e.g., play 5 to capture 5).
Sum: Add your card with board cards to match another (e.g., play 5 + board 5 = 10 to capture 10).


You can make multiple captures in one turn with the same hand card.


Place a Card:
After capturing (or if no capture is possible), place 1 hand card on the board.


Empty Board:
If the board is cleared, place 1 hand card on the board until captures are possible or hands are empty.



🛑 End of a Hand

A hand ends when only one player has cards left.
If the deck isn’t empty, deal 4 new cards per player (no new board cards unless empty).
If the board is empty, deal 4 board cards.

🪙 Scoring
At the end of the final hand (deck empty):

Score captured cards:
2–9: 5 points each
10, J, Q, K: 10 points each
Ace: 15 points


Add to your cumulative score.
If no moves are possible, the last player to capture takes all board cards.

🏆 Winning

Short: 500 points
Medium: 1000 points
Long: 1500 points
Break ties with additional hands.

💡 Strategy Tips

Save high-value cards (Aces, Kings) for big captures.
