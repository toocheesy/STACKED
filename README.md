## 🧠 What Is STACKED!?

**STACKED!** is a 2–4 player card game using a standard 52-card deck. The objective? Build the highest score by capturing cards from a shared board using strategic pairs and sum combinations. The game combines the feel of classic matching games with tactical math-based gameplay.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Score the most points by capturing cards using:
- **Pairs** (match values)
- **Arithmetic combos** (add cards together to match another)

The first player to reach the agreed score threshold (e.g., **500**, **1000**, or **1500** points) wins!

---

## 🃏 Setup

1. Use a standard 52-card deck (no Jokers).
2. Choose a dealer. The dealer shuffles and deals:
   - 4 cards to each player (clockwise)
   - 4 face-up cards to the center board
3. Play begins with the player to the dealer’s left (or who received the first card).

---

## 🔁 Gameplay

On your turn:

1. Attempt to **capture** cards using at least one card from the board:
   - Match a **pair**
   - Add card values together (e.g., 5 from hand + 5 from board = 10 on board)
2. You may make **multiple combos** in a turn if valid.
3. After making moves, if cards remain in your hand, place **1 card onto the board**.
4. If no valid move exists, place **1 card onto the board** and pass.

---

## 🛑 End of a Hand

- A hand ends when **only one player** has cards left.
- If the **board is ever cleared**, players continue by placing a card onto it on their turns.
- After each hand, if cards remain in the deck, deal 4 more to each player.
  - Only **refill the board with 4 new cards** if it’s completely empty.

---

## 🪙 Scoring

At the **end of the final hand** (when the deck is empty):

- Captured cards are scored:
  - **2–9** → 5 points each
  - **10, J, Q, K** → 10 points each
  - **Ace** → 15 points

Players add their round score to their **total cumulative score**.

## 🏆 Winning the Game

Choose your target score:
- Short Game → 500 points
- Medium Game → 1000 points
