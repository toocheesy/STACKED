# STACKED! SOFT LAUNCH — WHAT TO WATCH FOR

## FEEDBACK SIGNALS

### 🔴 HOTFIX NOW (don't wait for Friday)
- **Game-breaking bugs** — crashes, can't start game, can't complete a round
- **Payment/data issues** — if you add any purchases later, anything money-related
- **Offensive content somehow appearing** — shouldn't happen but if it does, immediate
- **Infinite loops** — game freezes, players stuck

*These break trust. Fix same day.*

---

### 🟡 ADD TO NEXT FRIDAY'S DEPLOY
- **Confusing UI** — "I didn't know I could do X"
- **Balance complaints** — "AI is too easy/hard"
- **Missing feedback** — "I didn't know my turn ended"
- **Mobile jank** — works but feels off
- **Feature requests** — "wish I could..."

*Note it. Don't react. Batch it.*

---

### 🟢 IGNORE (for now)
- **"I don't like card games"** — wrong audience, not your problem
- **"Make it more like [other game]"** — vision drift, politely thank them
- **One person's strong opinion** — wait for pattern (3+ people same complaint)
- **Feature creep requests** — "add multiplayer!" (that's Phase 2+)

*Thank them. Move on.*
